# Part 3
## Asynchronous Javascript

**Asynchronous JavaScript** — is a key concept that makes modern web applications fast and responsive.

Normally, JavaScript code runs line by line — this is called **synchronous** execution.  
But sometimes, tasks like **loading data from a server**, **waiting for a user action**, or **setting a timer** can take time.  
If JavaScript waited for each task to finish, it would freeze the page, and no one wants that!

That's where **Asynchronous JavaScript** comes in.

It allows JavaScript to start a task, and while waiting for it to complete, it moves on to the next task.  
When the waiting is over, the result comes back — usually through something called a **callback**, a **promise**, or with modern code, using **async/await**.

This way, your web pages stay smooth, fast, and user-friendly.
